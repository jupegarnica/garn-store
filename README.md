<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I created this project because I needed a super simple key-value database which could store data between script restarts. This is the result of that attempt.

Obviously it can't hold up with "real" databases but if you are just starting out developing a new project and you want a dead simple way to store data, this probably is the solution for you.

If you want to use it, please check out the docs for the project.

### Project Goals

- Store & Access key-value pairs
- Write stored data to disk
- Load stored data from disk
- Expose a dead simple API to developers
- Don't include anything else other than Deno std
